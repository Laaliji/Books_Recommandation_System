# Books Recommandation System - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to this project, a machine learning-based book recommendation system built using the Book-Crossing dataset. This project aims to cluster users based on their reading preferences and generate personalized book recommendations using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for developing a recommendation system that analyzes user ratings from the Book-Crossing dataset. The system preprocesses the data, applies clustering techniques, and provides recommendations based on user segments.

- **Dataset**: Book-Crossing (books.csv, ratings.csv, users.csv)
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering
- **Goal**: Segment users by preferences and recommend books accordingly

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset structure.
- Preprocessing to handle sparsity, missing values, and outliers.
- User segmentation using K-Means clustering.
- Visualization of clusters using PCA.
- Generation of personalized book recommendations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
